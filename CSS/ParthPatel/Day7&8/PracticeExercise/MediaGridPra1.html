        Various educators teach rules governing the length of paragraphs. They may say that a paragraph should be 100 to 200 words long, or be no more than five or six sentences. But a good paragraph should not be measured in characters, words, or sentences. The true measure of your paragraphs should be ideas.
        How many sentences are in a paragraph?
        Your childhood teacher did not wrong you when they taught you that there should be three, or four, or five sentences in a paragraph. It is important to understand, however, that the aim in teaching this was not to impart a hard-and-fast rule of grammar, drawn from an authoritative-but-dusty book. The true aim of this strategy was to teach you that your ideas must be well supported to be persuasive and effective.

        The model regarding paragraph length that your teacher undoubtedly taught you involves a topic sentence, a number of facts that support that core idea,
        and a concluding sentence. The proviso about the number of sentences between the topic sentence and the conclusion was not given to you
        because it was the magic formula for creating paragraphs of the perfect length; rather,
        your educator was attempting to give you a good reason to do adequate research on your topic.
        Academic writing yields the best examples of the topic-support-conclusion paragraph structure.
